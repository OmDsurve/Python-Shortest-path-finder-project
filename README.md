# Python-Shortest-path-finder-project
This Python project uses the `curses` library to visualize a maze solver in the terminal. It displays a maze with a start (`'O'`) and end (`'X'`) point. Using BFS, it finds the shortest path, highlighting it in red, while the maze is shown in blue. The solution updates in real-time as the algorithm runs.
